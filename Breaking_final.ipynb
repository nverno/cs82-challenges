    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As is typically the case with robots, autonomous vehicles use multiple sensors. Agent actions rely on integrating the precepts of these sensors. A number of methods are used to integrate uncertain information from sensors. Directed graphical models are a powerful and flexible approach to sensor integration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another difficulty for autonomous vehicles, and many other robotics problems, is uncertainty about the environment. In the case of autonomous vehicles the uncertainty can include road conditions, visibility conditions, and the actions of human drivers and pedestrians.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Directed graphical models provide a powerful representation for reasoning with uncertain sensor data and uncertainty in the environment. In this challenge you will perform learning and inference on a directed graphical model of braking for an autonomous vehicle. The goal of the agent is to control the braking of the autonomous vehicle to avoid collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The control of an actual autonomous vehicle is extremely complicated. Autonomous vehicles use many task-specific sensors. Further, any useful model has a large number of variables, many with complex continuous distribution models (e.g. mixture models). For this challenge, the number of senors and variables has been limited. Further, all distributions have simple Binomial posterior distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A practical autonomous vehicle would have a very low probability of collision with an object in its path; e.g. $p(collision) < 10^{-7}$. Since such small probability values are hard to work with, for this challenge, the probabilities of sensor errors and collisions are unrealistically high. "

    "#### Variables  \n",
    "\n",
    "The variables for the joint probability distribution are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Road Condition** is the condition of the road surface; 0 = good, 1 = slippery, eg. wet or icy.\n",
    "2. **Weather Visibility** is the optical (visual) visibility for the visual sensor; 0 = good, 1 = poor, eg. rain of fog. \n",
    "3. **Light Dark** is the lighting conditions for the road ahead; 0 = good, 1 = poor or dark.\n",
    "4. **Object** indicates an object in the vehicle's path; 0 = no object, 1 = object in path. \n",
    "5. **Road Condition Detection** is the conditional probability of the reading (precept) from a sensor that determines road condition, given the Road Condition variable; 0 = good, 1 = slippery, eg. wet or icy.\n",
    "6. **Weather Detection** is the conditional probability of the reading (precept) from a sensor that determines weather visibility, given the Weather Visibility Variable; 0 = good, 1 = poor, eg. rain of fog.\n",
    "7. **Visual Sensor Detection** is the conditional probability that the visual sensors see an object in the vehicle's path, or sense a non-existent object (false positive), give the Weather Visibility, Light Dark and Object variables; 0 = no object, 1 = object in path. \n",
    "8. **LIDAR Sensor Detection** is the conditional probability that the LIDAR sensor see an object in the vehicle's path, or sense a non-existent object (false positive), give the Object variable; 0 = no object, 1 = object in path. LIDAR uses infrared lasers for imaging and ranging. LIDAR is much less affected by rain and fog, but has lower resolution, when compared to a visual (optical) sensor. \n",
    "9. **Sensor Detection** is the integrated posterior distribution of an object being in the vehicle's path, or sensing a non-existent object (false positive), given the precepts of the Weather Detection, Dark Light, Visual Sensor Detection and LIDAR Sensor Detection variables; ; 0 = no object, 1 = object in path.\n",
    "10. **Early Breaking** is the conditional probability that the autonomous vehicle should apply breaks early to avoid a collision given the Road Condition Detection and Sensor Detection variables; 0 = normal breaking, 1 = apply early breaking. Early breaking should reduce the chances of collision but incurs a cost in terms of delay of the vehicle and other traffic. \n",
    "11. **Collision** is the conditional probability of the vehicle colliding with an object given the Object, Road Condition Detection and Sensor Detection variables; 0 = no collision, 1 = collision. "
